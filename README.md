## Technologies Used

- CSS: The web page's styling is done using CSS, including the use of CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the content.

- JavaScript: The web page's interactivity is implemented using JavaScript, including the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the web page's content and respond to user actions.

- JSON: The book data is stored in a JSON file, which is loaded using the Fetch API in JavaScript.

## Features

- Display a list of books: The web page displays a list of books, including their cover images, titles, and authors.

- Filter books by genre: Users can filter the list of books by genre using a dropdown menu.
